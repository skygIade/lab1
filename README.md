# This is my Lab 1 class homework done in my Big Data Degree in the University of Wollongong.


I am pretty new to Java, and as such, I have realised my mistakes as provided by my lecturers
I should have set up a default constructor, then do some copying of constructors, initialise those values etc. etc.
You can use this as a template. :)
